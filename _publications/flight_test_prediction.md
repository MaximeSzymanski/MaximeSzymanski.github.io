collection: publications
permalink: /publication/flight_test_predition
excerpt: 'A study was conducted at the Laboratory of Applied Research in Active Control, Avionics, and AeroServoElasticity (LARCASE) to propose an innovative methodology for identifying a model for a specific aircraft using Neural Networks. This artificial intelligence-based model was specifically designed to learn and predict the aircraft flight dynamics under a wide range of operating conditions.'
