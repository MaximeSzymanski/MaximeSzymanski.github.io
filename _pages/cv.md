Education
======
* M.Eng (Double Degree) in Computer Science, University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard, 2019 – Present **(GPA: 4.1/4.3)**
* M.S. in Anomaly Detection using Deep Learning, École de Technologie Supérieure, 2023 – Present **(GPA: 4.2/4.3)**

Work Experience
======
* **MSc Research Thesis: Anomaly Detection in Time Series with Deep Learning — Sept 2023 – July 2025**
  - Collaborated with CAE on a project focused on enhancing **anomaly detection in time series data**.
  - Developed an innovative method for detecting sensor faults using SOTA time series models, from AutoEncoders to **Graph Neural Networks**.
  - Applied **meta-learning** to reduce overfitting and improve generalization across datasets, resulting in a more robust anomaly detection model.
  - Utilized **LoRA** to reduce fine-tuning parameters by **98%**, lowering computational costs while maintaining performance.
  - Modified the **TSMixer** architecture, achieving **10%** higher accuracy than **SOTA models** in anomaly detection, setting a new research benchmark.

* **Research Internship: Map Matching Algorithm for Ground Trajectory Analysis of Aircraft — Sept 2022 – Feb 2023**
  - Conducted research on aircraft ground trajectory analysis.
  - Developed a map-matching algorithm to improve operational efficiency and data collection.
  - Led the development using Hidden Markov Models; optimized trajectories with machine learning; implemented a MARL environment using the PPO algorithm.
  - Achieved a **5%** reduction in airport fuel consumption and created a solution that successfully matched **96%** of trajectories; findings presented at the AIAA Aviation Conference.
