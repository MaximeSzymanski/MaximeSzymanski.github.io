I'm a second years MSc. at the [École de Technologie Supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/) in Montréal Canada, currently working on **Anomaly Detection on  Time series** using Deep Learning technics. Currently seeking a **PhD opportunity** in **Reinforcement Learning**, I'm passionate about Deep RL and Time series analysis. Before my MSc, I completed a MEng. at the [Université de Technologie de Belfort Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr/) in France.

Research 
======
My current research interests are the following :
- Time Series imputation of physic systems sensors using Deep Learning
- Sequence Modeling and State Spaces Models (Mamba)
- Graph-Based path optimization using Reinforcement Learning
- Mutli-Agent Reinforcement Learning (cooperation/competition)
- Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
