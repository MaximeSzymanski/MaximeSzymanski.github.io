- Side project focused on implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms in Atari environments.
- Develop and evaluate a collection of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Implemented various algorithms using PyTorch; developed DQN, PPO, and DDPG; integrated solutions with Atari games in OpenAI Gym.
- Achieved performance reaching the same reward as the baseline PPO and DQN papers with only 5% more training time steps, providing ready-to-use code to the community.
