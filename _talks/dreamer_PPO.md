- Implemented a Dreamer-style PPO agent using PyTorch for Atari environments, combining model-based RL with policy optimization.
- Designed and trained transition and reward models to enable latent-space imagination rollouts for improved sample efficiency.
-  Integrated Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) and PPO with auxiliary model learning for stable and efficient policy updates.
- Achieved superior performance over vanilla PPO on SeaquestNoFrameskip-v4, demonstrating the effectiveness of imagined rollouts.
