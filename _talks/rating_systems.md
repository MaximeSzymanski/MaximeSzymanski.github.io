- Project at McGill University analyzing the effectiveness of rating algorithms in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
- Evaluate and compare various rating systems and their impacts on performance.
- Designed and implemented a Python analysis project; developed algorithms including PPO, DQN, A2C, Random, and
Deterministic; investigated rating algorithms such as Elo, Glicko, Glicko2, and TrueSkill.
- The project demonstrated that rating systems significantly influence training outcomes, revealing that using the Glicko
rating system with DQN could improve the diversity of a population of agents by **25%**. This contributed to a deeper
understanding of how rating systems affect reinforcement learning performance.
