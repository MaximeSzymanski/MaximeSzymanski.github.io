- Project at the University of Technology of Belfort Montbeliard focused on developing a stocks clustering algorithm.
- Analyze and cluster stock data to identify patterns and similarities.
- Developed the algorithm using Python; leveraged K-Means clustering, PCA, and Auto-Encoder techniques; received
support from Google through AutoML funding.
- Created a robust stocks clustering algorithm that provided improved insights into market patterns, enhanced by additional
resources and support.
